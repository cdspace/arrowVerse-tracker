# arrowVerse-tracker
Track watched arrowVerse episodes and air dates

This project will initially be a Tcl/Tk desktop version using Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL v10.

Eventually there will be a subfolder and/or branch to support a deployment on Heroku.com as a web-based viewer, keeping the postgreSQL backend.

This project is based on the arrow-verse viewer by AceFire6 at

I'm not trying to duplicate their work, but basing this project on theirs as way to learn Tcl/Tk, PostgreSQL, and Heroku deployment.
